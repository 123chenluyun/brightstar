#notes 

What'd I learn? 

-jest with snapshots 
-react, react dom and react-renderer all come together but getting the correct versions to work together isn't documented well
-when combining components with custom node libraries, renderer does not like it and you will not see your expected results 
-jest runs a lot like jasmine
-asset management loading would've been included in my library to 
-if you're using babel to compile your code you need to make sure to tell jest that you're using babel and install the proper dependicies
-the documentation isn't always right
